#Rotations Project

<p>A python program that will rotate a curve about another curve and plot it.</p>

<p>y = x rotated about y = x^2:</p>
![Alt text](figure_1.png?raw=true "y = x rotated about y = x^2")
<p>y = x rotated about y = sin(pi*x):</p>
![Alt text](figure_2.png?raw=true "y = x rotated about y = sin(pi*x)")
